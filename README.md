## Supported Versions ðŸŒˆ

* GTA San Andreas - v1.0

Other versions of the game *will not* work and will most likely cause a crash.

Check this link if you wish to downgrade a later version to a compatible version - https://dl1.rockstarnexus.com/gta/sa/GTASA_12-9-14_Steam_to_V1_DG.exe

## Installation ðŸŒˆ

Installation requires an ASI Loader to be installed. 

[Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) by [ThirteenAG](https://github.com/ThirteenAG) is a popular option since it supports CrashDumps, which will be necessary if you want to report a crash.

If you already have mods like CLEO, you probably already have an ASI Loader installed. 

1. To install the Ultimate ASI Loader, simply extract the Ultimate ASI Loader's dinput8.dll file to the game's root directory (with gta_sa.exe), and rename it to `vorbisFile.dll` if necessary (For Example, while using dinput8.dll for mouse fix already)
2. To install Rainbomizer, download the release archive from [Releases](https://github.com/Zarig/Rainbomizer/releases) and extract the asi and the toml file to the `scripts` folder or the root directory.

## Configuration ðŸŒˆ

If you wish to change any of the mod's functionalities, for example to disable a specific randomizer, a configuration file (`rainbomizer.toml`) has been provided with the mod.

The default configuration file is in the main repository, `config.toml`, but it is automatically created by the mod if it doesn't exist in the same folder as the asi file.

The configuration file is in the TOML format. It is similar in structure to ini's but with a defined and better structure. 

To configure a specific randomizer, search for its name in the configuration file. You can set the "Enabled" key to 'true' or 'false' to enable or disable it respectively.

More information about how to configure specific randomizers is provided in the default config file.
